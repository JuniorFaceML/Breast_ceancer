## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to conduct an analysis and create a model for classifying breast tumors, specifically to differentiate between malignant and benign tumors. The provided data from Kaggle is substantial and sufficient to develop a model with high performance metrics. The model has been created with excellent metrics, and the objective of achieving the best metrics compared to other Kaggle participants has been accomplished.
